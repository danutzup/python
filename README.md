# python
Some python code I am using and writting
I have found in internet following python coe and pages related to raspberry pi and ST7920 conected using spi :
http://www.astromik.org/raspi/42.htm
https://github.com/SrBrahma/RPi-12864-LCD-ST7920-lib/tree/master
And I did with the help of ChatGPT transform that python code in a library that can be used in any python code to display on this lcd text data. 
for connection schematic see glcd12864-sch.gif

In my enviroment I have multiple esp8266 running tasmota frimware that are pushing to a mosquito server 
with nodejs running.
